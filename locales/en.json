  "playing": "The IPA Declaration, created in 1977 and updated in 1982 and 1989, is like a special promise that says all kids have the right to play, learn, and grow. It's backed by a big rule from the United Nations that says every child should have time to play and enjoy cultural activities. Playing helps kids in many waysâ€”it helps us talk, feel good, make friends, and learn new things. But sometimes, there are problems that stop kids from playing, like not having safe places or too much focus on schoolwork. The IPA group has ideas to help kids play more, be healthy, and be happy. They work with governments and groups to make sure kids everywhere can play and have fun.",
  "educations": "In 2002, India updated its Constitution to include Article 21-A, ensuring kids aged 6 to 14 get free and compulsory education. This led to the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act in 2009. Starting in 2010, every child has the right to attend a nearby school for free until they finish elementary education. The RTE Act also ensures that all kids, even if they start late, get admitted to school. The government is responsible for making sure schools are good with enough trained teachers. Teachers shouldn't do other jobs during school hours. Schools can't hit or bully kids or ask for extra money. Plus, schools should offer a safe and friendly learning environment.",
  "health": "Every child should be healthy, and it's up to the government to make sure of it. This means giving kids good doctors and hospitals to go to when they're sick. Governments also need to make sure kids have good food to eat and live in clean and safe places. There's a special rule called Article 24 that talks about how important health is for kids. It says kids should have both a healthy body and mind. They should eat well, live in safe places, and not work in dangerous places. Kids also have the right to learn about their health so they can make good choices. So, making sure kids are healthy means giving them good healthcare, healthy food, safe places to live, and teaching them about staying healthy.",
  "working": "The Child Labour Act from 1986 says that kids under 14 years old shouldn't work. There's also a committee to help decide what jobs kids can't do. Kids shouldn't work between 7 p.m. and 8 a.m., and if someone makes a kid work during these times or breaks the rules, they could go to jail for up to a year or have to pay a fine.The law was changed in 2016 to match the Right to Education Act, saying a child is someone under 14 years old or the age set by the Right to Education Act. There are new rules that say kids can't work in dangerous jobs. If someone breaks the rules, the police can investigate and arrest them without needing a court's permission.There are other laws too, like the Factories Act from 1948, which says kids under 14 can't work in factories. Kids between 15 to 18 years old can work in a factory if they are healthy and have a certificate from a doctor. They can work for only four and a half hours and shouldn't work at night.The Mines Act from 1952 says kids under 18 can't work in mines, and those over 16 can work only with special care.",
  "life": "The right to life means that every person has the right to live, grow, and become an adult. It's like a big rule that says everyone should be safe and have a chance to grow up healthy and happy. From the moment a baby is born, this right says that their life should be protected. This is because every person is important and should be taken care of. It also means that no one should hurt or do anything bad to someone else on purpose. For kids, this means they should always be safe and protected by adults. Countries have a job to make sure that kids are safe and that nothing bad happens to them."
