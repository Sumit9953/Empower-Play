It abolishes fees and charges that might impede access to education and imposes an obligation on the government to ensure enrollment, attendance, and completion of elementary education for all children. The RTE Act also outlines norms and standards for schools, pupil-teacher ratios, infrastructure, and teacher qualifications. Additionally, it prohibits practices like physical punishment, screening procedures for admission, and running unrecognized schools. By implementing this act, India has embraced a rights-based approach to education, emphasizing equity and inclusivity in the schooling system.",

    "health":"Every child has the fundamental right to optimal health, and it is the responsibility of governments to ensure this right is upheld. This includes providing access to high-quality healthcare services and facilities. Additionally, governments must prioritize measures to guarantee children have access to nutritious food and reside in environments that promote cleanliness and well-being, thereby fostering their overall health. Article 24 of the UNCRC emphasizes the importance of healthcare for children and young people, asserting their entitlement to both physical and mental well-being. This entails adequate nourishment, a safe living environment, and protection from hazardous work conditions. Furthermore, Article 24 underscores children's right to receive information about their health, empowering them to make informed decisions and express their preferences regarding healthcare services. Overall, ensuring children's right to be as healthy as possible involves a comprehensive approach encompassing healthcare access, nutrition, environmental safety, and informed decision-making."
